    <p><Strong>Ko Tao</Strong> (also often Koh Tao; Thai: à¹€à¸à¸²à¸°à¹€à¸•à¹ˆà¸², pronounced [kÉ”Ì€Ê” tÃ w], lit.â€‰''Turtle Island'') is an
        island in
        Thailand and is part of the Chumphon Archipelago on the western shore of the Gulf of Thailand. It covers an area
        of about 21 km2 (8 sq mi). Administratively it is a subdistrict (tambon) of Ko Pha-ngan District (amphoe) of
        Surat Thani Province. As of 2006, its official population was 1,382.[citation needed] The main settlement is Ban
        Mae Haad.

        The economy of the island is almost exclusively centered on tourism, especially scuba diving. Scuba diving is
        extremely popular in Ko Tao due to clear visibility, inexpensive pricing and the range of sealife to be seen.[1
