    <p><Strong>Koh Phangan </Strong>(also spelt Ko Pha-Ngan) is Thailandâ€™s 5th biggest island and one of the most
        beautiful and wild.
        Located 70 km from the mainland and just 12 km from Koh Samui, Phangan does not have an airport and relies
        heavily on ferries from the mainland and Koh Samui to transport visitors.

        The island is renowned for its lush tropical jungle interior, many idyllic, long, white-sand beaches and over 20
        nearby dive sites. The main disembarkation points are Thongsala and Haad Rin, where you'll find plenty of ATM
        machines and banks. Koh Phanganâ€™s main claim to fame is its legendary Full Moon Party, Black Moon Party with the
        Full Moon celebrations attracting between 10,000 and 30,000 revellers during New Yearâ€™s Eve.</p>
