    <p>Eighteen years ago this August, I was a first-time visitor to both Thailand and Koh Samui. I thought I was just
        headed on a â€œtypical beach vacationâ€, so I was surprised at how badly wrong I got the Thai dress code.
        Culture-wise and climate-wise: my packing got an F. An F minus. <br> <br><Strong>My packing and dress code
            mistakes</Strong><br> <br> 2003 Fashion Crimes included J-Lo sunglasses, visors â€¦ and worse. Add at least
        five Bacardi Breezers to every
        photo and itâ€™s not pretty. Yet, the worst of a bad bunch was a pair of cut-off jean shorts â€“ they were way too
        short for Thailandâ€™s modest culture and way too hot for the tropics. To make matters worse, I paired the shorts
        with an Avril Lavigne-esque tube top â€¦ and went sightseeing at Koh Samuiâ€™s Big Buddha. A temple. Bad bad bad,
        but I didnâ€™t know any better.
